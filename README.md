# mobile-app

A simple mobile app page 

I'm thinking about putting the 8/16 buttons into a table to make it more readable afterwards for me, so I can just check the table with a loop

Also need to rethink the 8/16 button - maybe change it a mode you need to pick before you enter... otherwise make them to toggle buttons which has to be picked.

things to add:
tap buttons for BPM
some safe system to safe your patterns
remove buttons for not in use instruments
